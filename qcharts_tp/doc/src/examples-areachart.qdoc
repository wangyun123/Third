     The example shows how to create simple area chart.

    To create area charts, we need two QLineSeries instances. They are going to define upper and lower boundary of the area. 

    \snippet ../examples/areachart/main.cpp 1

    We add data to both series, we use stream operator.  

    \snippet ../examples/areachart/main.cpp 2

    Now we create QAreaSeries instance using two line series objects. We set the custom gradient fill and width of the outline. 

    \snippet ../examples/areachart/main.cpp 3
    
    In the end we create QChartView instance, set title, set anti-aliasing and add area series. We also set the specific range for axes.

    Chart is ready to be shown.

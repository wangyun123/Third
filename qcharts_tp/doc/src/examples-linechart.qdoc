     The example shows how to create simple line chart.

    To create line chart, QLineSeries instance is needed. Let's create one. 

    \snippet ../examples/linechart/main.cpp 1

    Then we add data to series. We can use add() member function or use stream operator.  

    \snippet ../examples/linechart/main.cpp 2

    To present the data on the char we need QChart instance. We add the series to it and set the title of the chart.

    \snippet ../examples/linechart/main.cpp 3

    Then we create a QChartView object with QChart as a parameter. This way we don't need to create QGraphicsView scene ourselves. We also set the Antialiasing on to have the rendered lines look nicer.

    The example shows how to create simple spline chart.

    To create spline chart we need to put our data into QSplineSeries. QSplineSeries automatically calculates spline segment control points that are needed to properly draw the spline.

    \snippet ../examples/splinechart/main.cpp 1

Now let's add some data points to the series.
	
	\snippet ../examples/splinechart/main.cpp 2

The data series has been populated. To display it on a chart we create QChart object and add the data series to it. We also set the title and the values range on y axis, so that our chart is better visible.

Then we create a QChartView object with QChart as a parameter. This way we don't need to create QGraphicsView scene ourselves. We also set the Antialiasing on to have the rendered lines look nicer.

    In the end we set the QChartView  as the windows's central widget.
